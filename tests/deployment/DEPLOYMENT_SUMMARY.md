2. **Resource Management**:
   - CPU and memory limits for all services
   - Health checks with retries and timeouts
   - Proper restart policies and dependency management

3. **Data Persistence**:
   - Dedicated volumes for database, logs, and application data
   - Backup service with automated retention policies
   - Mount points configured for production paths

### Deployment Tools Created
1. **Docker Validation Suite** (`tests/deployment/docker_validator.py`)
   - Validates Docker Compose configurations, Dockerfiles, support files
   - Environment configuration and deployment script testing

2. **Deployment Validation Suite** (`tests/deployment/deployment_validator.py`)
   - Tests deployment scripts, health checks, backup procedures
   - Monitoring configuration validation

3. **Production Docker Configuration** (`docker-compose.prod.yml`)
   - Complete production stack with monitoring and backup
   - Security hardening and resource optimization
   - SSL/TLS ready with certificate management

4. **Docker Support Files**:
   - `docker/Dockerfile.api` - Multi-stage API container
   - `docker/Dockerfile.web` - Nginx-based frontend container
   - `docker/nginx.conf` - Production-ready web server configuration
   - `docker/prometheus/prometheus.yml` - Monitoring configuration
   - `docker/backup/backup.sh` - Automated backup script

### Monitoring and Observability
- **Prometheus**: Metrics collection from all services
- **Grafana**: Dashboard and alerting (accessible at port 3001)
- **Loki**: Centralized log aggregation and analysis
- **Health Checks**: All services have comprehensive health monitoring

### Backup and Recovery
- **Automated Backups**: PostgreSQL, Redis, and application data
- **Retention Policy**: 30-day automated cleanup
- **Backup Manifest**: JSON metadata for each backup
- **Container-based**: Runs in isolated backup service

## Recommendations for Production Deployment

### Immediate Actions Required
1. **Environment Configuration**:
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure production values
   - Set strong passwords for database and Grafana
   - Configure API keys for OpenAI and Anthropic

2. **SSL/TLS Setup**:
   - Obtain SSL certificates for HTTPS
   - Configure domain names and DNS
   - Update CORS origins for production domain

3. **Infrastructure Preparation**:
   - Ensure sufficient disk space in `/opt/qaai/` directories
   - Configure firewall rules for required ports
   - Set up monitoring alerts in Grafana

### Optional Enhancements
1. **Rate Limiting**: Configure rate limiting for production API protection
2. **Authentication**: Implement user authentication for sensitive endpoints
3. **CDN Integration**: Use CDN for static asset delivery
4. **Database Scaling**: Consider read replicas for high-traffic deployments
